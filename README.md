This is my first Machine Learning project

Title:
Mobile Price Range Prediction Based on Machine Learning

Project Description:
Embarking on my first Machine Learning project, I've developed an application using Django that predicts the price range of mobile phones. Alongside the Django app, I've included CSV files containing relevant data and a Jupyter notebook for analysis. Before running the app, ensure you've installed the necessary dependencies using the provided commands. Don't forget to update the file "views.py" with the correct location of "mobile_data.csv". After setup, execute "python manage.py runserver" to launch the application.

Tools and Technologies:

IDE: VSCode
Environment: Anaconda (for running Jupyter Notebook)
Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
Framework: Django
Instructions:

Install dependencies: pip3 install django pandas seaborn virtualenv matplotlib
Update "views.py" with the correct path to "mobile_data.csv".
Run the Django server: python manage.py runserver
